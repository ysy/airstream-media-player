    /// Class that deals with the communication between the application and the device. Loads up separate threads to deal with concurrent communication from the device. 
    /// iOS devices seem to open two connections to the server which remain open and do not close after every request (it seems):
    /// - The first connection starts by sending the "POST /reverse HTTP/1.1" header, indicating this connection will be for two way communication. The application can send requests to the iOS device (which it will reply to), and the iOS device can send requests to the application (which the application will need to reply to). This connection seems to be used for the iOS device to send playback requests to the application (such as "play this URL", "seek to this position", "pause" or "stop), and also for the application to send playback events to the iOS device (such as "the file is loading", "playback has started", "playback is paused" etc. The events are sent as XML/plist files)
    /// - The second connection seems to be used for one way communication. "GET /scrub HTTP/1.1" requests are sent from the iOS device to get the current playback position from the application, to update the track progress on the iOS device. It seems that when a file has finished playing this connection is closed by the iOS device, and reopened when needed. Unlike the first connection which seems to constantly remain open.
